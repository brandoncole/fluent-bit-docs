# HTTP

The __http__ output plugin, allows to flush your records into an HTTP end point. For now the functionality is pretty basic and it issue a POST request with the data records in [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org) format.

> In future versions the target URI and data format will be configurable.

### TLS / SSL

HTTP output plugin supports TTL/SSL, for more details about the properties available and general configuration, please refer to the [TLS/SSL](../configuration/tls_ssl.md) section.

## Getting Started

In order to insert records into a HTTP server, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file:

### Command Line

The __http__ plugin, can read the parameters from the command line in two ways, through the __-p__ argument (property) or setting them directly through the service URI. The URI format is the following:

```
http://host:port/something
```

Using the format specified, you could start Fluent Bit through:

```
$ fluent-bit -i cpu -t cpu -o http://192.168.2.3:80/something -o stdout -m '*'
```

### Configuration File

In your main configuration file append the following _Input_ & _Output_ sections:

```Python
[INPUT]
    Name  cpu
    Tag   cpu

[OUTPUT]
    Name  http
    Match *
    Host  192.168.2.3
    Port  80
    URI   /something
```
